Facial recognition to paint and stamp from webcam - a drawing tool.

This sketch is a tool or instrument that uses facial recognition to identify what part of the screen to capture.
The examples uploaded were made using this sketch. The program is not necessarily intuitive and there is somewhat of a learning curve when it comes to interacting with the program, as well as the web cam. Throughout the process of writing the sketch and making the uploaded examples, I became familiar with the dimensions of my camera's field of view, as well as the properties of the program and the limitations of my computer. Using the lag of the program to my advantage, I learned to spoof the camera to take the pictures that I wanted. I also learned that, by manipulating the orientation of my laptop on the household objects around me, I could get the program to capture an image.

I believe that this project makes for an interesting tool. Photography is an enjoyable past-time, but some people (myself included) donâ€™t have the patients to Photoshop, crop, and manipulate the images into something new. I find the manipulation of still images in this way very appealing, but not obvious or intuitive in practice. This program makes this process of collaging more readily accessible and introduces hostilities that are unique to the platform. In my experience, the use of this sketch as a drawing tool does present a number of hindrances, while also making for a plethora of new and interesting possibilities.

Its fun, but can be very frustrating. Once you collect a number of images you like, press the Down Arrow to save it and move the file to another folder (It will over write (my bad)), and be careful moving forward because its easy to mess up.
